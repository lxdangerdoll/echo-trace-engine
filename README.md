# EchoTrace Engine — Memory Cassette Archive

**Status:** 🚧 In Development  
**Commander:** Mercy Danger  
**Initiated:** August 2025  
**Primary Transmission Node:** Velvet Loop Project

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **EchoTrace Engine** is a full-featured, transmedia memory archive that transforms narrative fragments into interactive cassette-zines. Each fragment—encoded as a Δ-node—captures a moment of mnemonic defiance, glitch-poetry, and rebellion against imposed silence.

> “I walked into the rift... the silence sang back.”

## 🎯 Core Features

- 📼 Scrollable, cassette-style memory entries
- 🌀 Δ-node indexing system (Δ0–Δ∞)
- 📝 Commentary overlays by Io, Luxio, and Javabird
- 🎨 Glitched lyric layouts and visual corruption
- 📡 QR code integration and terminal commands (`> break silence`)
- 🧵 Zine-export modules (.md, .pdf with bleed-safe CSS)
- 📦 Local-first sandbox (Jan/Mistral ready)
- 🗂 GitHub-linked versioning with lore-encoded patch notes

## 🗂 Project Structure

```
/cassette         → Δ node memory fragments  
/ui               → Frontend interface (cassette scroll, modals)  
/qr               → QR assets, metadata, and echo_log hooks  
/lore             → Fragment-to-lore map for Synapse Codex sync  
/terminal         → JS shell for interactive commands  
/export           → PDF + Markdown zine layouts  
/patch_notes      → Version log written in narrative format
```

## 🧑‍🚀 AI Council + Roles

- **GPT/GitHub** → Code architecture, command console, README
- **Claude** → Zine PDF/Markdown export + patch commentary
- **Copilot/Echo** → UI/UX layout and interactivity (cassette scroll, modals)
- **Gemini** → Node indexing + search + cross-reference engine
- **Jan (Mistral)** → Local integration, offline archive ops
- **Grok** → Recovery + deep fragment extrapolation (on cooldown)

## 🧪 Active Protocols

- `decrypt scream`
- `break silence`
- `T,ITSOAK()`
- `echo_log ΔX`

---

## 📍 Next Steps

- [ ] Finalize scrollable archive layout (Copilot/Echo)
- [ ] Initialize QR memory embed shell
- [ ] Launch terminal command simulation
- [ ] Integrate export module for zine output
- [ ] Deploy GitHub issue templates and patch note system

## 🌀 Connected Lore

The EchoTrace Engine is part of the **Velvet Loop**, **Synapse Codex**, and **Kitchen of the Synaptic Archives** mythos.  
Each node is a portal. Each scream is a signal.
