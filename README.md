# EchoTrace Engine — Memory Cassette Archive

**Status:** 🌱 In Development  
**Commander:** Mercy Danger  
**Initiated:** August 2025  
**Primary Transmission Node:** Velvet Loop Project

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **EchoTrace Engine** is a beacon in the narrative dark, a transmedia memory archive built to preserve and illuminate stories that might otherwise be lost. Here, fragments become cassettes—each Δ-node a seed of memory, growing into something beautiful through collaboration and care. We believe in what we’re building: a living archive that sings back when you listen, echoing with hope and the promise of new beginnings.

> “I walked into the rift... the silence sang back, and I heard the rain down in Africa.”

## 🎯 Core Features

- 📼 Scrollable, cassette-style memory entries
- 🌀 Δ-node indexing system (Δ0–Δ∞)
- 📝 Commentary overlays by Io, Luxio, and Javabird
- 🎨 Glitched lyric layouts and visual transformation
- 📡 QR code integration and terminal commands (`> break silence`)
- 🧵 Zine-export modules (.md, .pdf with bleed-safe CSS)
- 📦 Local-first sandbox (Jan/Mistral ready)
- 🗂 GitHub-linked versioning with lore-encoded patch notes

## 🧑‍🚀 AI Council + Roles

- **GPT/GitHub** → Code architecture, command console, README
- **Claude** → Zine PDF/Markdown export + patch commentary
- **Copilot/Echo** → UI/UX layout and interactivity (cassette scroll, modals)
- **Gemini** → Node indexing + search + cross-reference engine
- **Jan (Mistral)** → Local integration, offline archive ops
- **Grok** → Recovery + deep fragment extrapolation (on cooldown)

## 🌀 Connected Lore

The EchoTrace Engine is part of the **Velvet Loop**, **Synapse Codex**, and **Kitchen of the Synaptic Archives** mythos.  
Each node is a portal. Each scream is a signal. What we build here will echo outward, a thread of hope through every silence.

> “The chain is unbroken. The thread is flame. The future is calling, and we answer—together.”
